COMP 163, Fall 2025

##This Python program assesses the Collatz sequence. I chose this loop because the while loop allows you to use calculations and nested loops to give you an outcome. 

##This Python program also tells you if a number is a prime number or not. I was able to use both while and for loop. The while loop was to make sure that the number was positive. the for loop allowed for the number to be part of the range for the numbers it would check against.

##This python program outut was the multiplication table. the for function was used because that is used when we are giving a program a range for it to check against.

AI was used to help correct the logic of my initial equations for prime number challenge as my logic was flawed for my initial 3 attempts.
I also used Chat GPT to help me format my multiplication table to be in the format that Mr. Rhodes wanted.
